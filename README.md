# 2D-pathfinding-simulation

This is a 1st year university assignment for a course in basic programming, coded in C.The assignment was done using many basic C programming concepts. 

It prints a list of options if run from the command line, giving the user options for how the program is to run and giving step by step feedback during the simulation. This script finds the shortest route between 2 points on a grid which may include impassable areas, as illustrated below. Note that it uses the Dijkstra algorithm, which was provided to me (I don't know how that algorithm works).

The repository only servers to illustrate my coding abilities. See the source file if that interests you.
